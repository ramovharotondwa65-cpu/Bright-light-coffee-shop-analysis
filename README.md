The analysis of the coffee shop's performance highlights both revenue and transaction trends across different time frames and store locations. weekly, monthly and daily revenue reports reveal steady growth with noticeable peaks during the weekdays, the beginning of the week and the mind year period, showing higher customer activity at those times. Daily revenue analysis shows that the mornings are the busiest hours and they generate the most money overall confirming a demand of coffee on when people are going to work, Weekily revenue analysis shows that Monday generates the most money and Tuesday, Friday, Thursday and Wednesday following behind closely and lastly Revenue by month shows that June generates the largest amount of revenue coming at 23.8% sales which means the is a demand of coffee due to the weather. The product that as generated the most revenue is Tea which shows that most of the demands from morning sales are for tea.

# Recommendations of improvement 
Due to my observation i would recommend that the coffee shop would close early to ensure the employees full satisfaction so when they come back in the morning where most of the sales are happening they come back ready to work. 
and i woud recommend that the business starts to make large quantity of food to serve all those morning clients 
-i would recommend that in june the business hires more people to work there because june also has a high sales rate so they wouldcome to help bring more productivity
